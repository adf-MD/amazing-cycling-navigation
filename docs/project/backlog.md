# Planning backlog — full pending item specifications

This file holds the complete, byte-preserved specification for every backlog item that is **approved future work but not yet implemented**, plus the two items that are explicitly monitored/investigated-but-unconfirmed (see [current-status.md](current-status.md) instead for those two — items 32 and 66).

Item numbers are stable identifiers across this project's entire documentation set — they never change regardless of which file an item's text lives in. See [README.md](README.md) for the full map of where everything lives, and the root [`CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md) for durable product/engineering rules and the required reading order before implementing any item here.

No successor item has been selected yet — item 73 (the previous "next" item) is now complete; see [`docs/project/history/items-69-73.md`](history/items-69-73.md#item-73). The remaining entries below are approved future work, but none is currently scheduled as the next implementation slice.

Entries below are ordered by item number (not by their original position in the source document, since categories repeated non-contiguously there). Each entry reproduces its original text verbatim, with only the minimal bracketed pointers needed to keep cross-references navigable after this document was split out of a single monolithic `CLAUDE.md` (see that root file's own note on this).

## Item 11 — Weather

_Category: Optional external-data feature_

11. **Weather**
    - Candidate provider: Open-Meteo free non-commercial API, no API key.
    - Current conditions plus approximately the next three hours.
    - Temperature, precipitation, wind speed, gusts and direction.
    - Manual or restrained refresh, never a dependency of Planning/Riding.
    - Required attribution and privacy disclosure because location is sent to a weather provider.
    - Must fail independently and gracefully.

## Item 12 — Offline map storage

_Category: Separate feasibility project_

12. **Offline map storage**
    - Do not implement until the active tile provider explicitly permits deliberate offline prefetching.
    - Investigate route-corridor/selected-area storage, style/sprite/glyph dependencies, iOS eviction, size estimates and available-storage checks.
    - Preferred eventual architecture: global tile cache keyed by URL, per-route references, deduplication across routes, deletion only when no route references a tile.
    - Offer bounded detail presets and estimate storage before download.
    - Never bulk-prefetch from an OSMF community tile endpoint that prohibits offline download.

## Item 16 — Desktop two-column Planning layout

_Category: Planning visual-organisation follow-ups_

16. **Desktop two-column Planning layout**
    - The fourth visual-migration slice (Interface and accessibility section, [now in `docs/project/history/interface-accessibility-migration.md`]) deliberately kept Planning as a single, width-constrained column (`.planning-section`, max-width 720px) rather than a two-column grid, since the brief explicitly permitted either and a single column carries no DOM/tab-order risk.
    - If pursued later, use CSS Grid with explicit `grid-template-areas` placement while keeping JSX/DOM order linear (Waypoints → Route options → Route overview → Save/export) — never reorder the markup itself to achieve a visual pairing, so keyboard and reading order stay sequential regardless of visual column position.

## Item 28 — Optional adaptive compact navigation while scrolling

_Category: Navigation and library interface_

28. **Optional adaptive compact navigation while scrolling**
    - A possible later visual refinement to the always-sticky primary navigation delivered in item 24 above [docs/project/history/items-06-29.md]. The user is currently unsure whether they want this at all — it is a candidate direction only, not approved or scheduled work, and must not be started without explicit confirmation.
    - Motivation: the full sticky icon-and-label row occupies noticeable vertical space on long screens such as Planning.
    - Candidate behaviour, all subject to later confirmation and none of it settled: at the top of a sticky screen, show the current full icons-and-labels navigation; after a meaningful downward scroll, collapse it into a shorter icon-only sticky row; after a meaningful upward scroll, expand it again before the user reaches the top; at the top of the page, always use the expanded presentation; retain accessible names for every destination while text labels are visually hidden; preserve the current non-sticky behaviour during active Riding rather than adding any compact/sticky scroll handling there.
    - Any implementation would need scroll-direction state plus hysteresis/thresholds so small touch movements and scroll bounce do not cause rapid toggling; would need to expand when keyboard focus enters the navigation; would need to respect `prefers-reduced-motion` if a size transition is used; and must not create a second navigation element, change current-page semantics, or reduce effective touch targets below the existing minimum.
    - Decisions that remain open and must be settled with the user before any implementation prompt is written, not invented here: whether to build this at all; which sticky screens should use it, or whether all sticky screens should behave consistently; the downward-collapse and upward-expand thresholds; whether any upward movement expands it immediately or a separate upward hysteresis distance is required; the compact bar's exact height, icon size, padding and visual separation from scrolling content; whether expansion should also occur on navigation focus, destination change or orientation change; whether the compact-to-expanded transition should animate, and its reduced-motion behaviour; and real iOS Safari and Android Chrome acceptance criteria.
    - Keep this item outside the immediate ordered implementation sequence. It must not displace Android compatibility acceptance (item 25), editable GPX conversion (item 26), route reversal (item 27), weather (item 11), offline-map feasibility (item 12), the optional desktop Planning layout (item 16), or the still-pending bicycle field acceptance items recorded under "Manual acceptance status" above (now in `docs/project/current-status.md`). It must not be merged into active Riding's navigation work — active Riding's non-sticky contract (item 24 above [docs/project/history/items-06-29.md]) is settled and unaffected by this idea. Implementing this item does not reopen or mark incomplete the already-delivered item 24.

## Item 59 — Elevation and recognised-climb discrepancy investigation

_Category: Riding elevation enhancement_

59. **Elevation and recognised-climb discrepancy investigation**
    - Field observation (unverified against ground truth, not yet a confirmed defect): on one ride, ACN's planned figure was approximately 640 m ascent versus approximately 540 m recorded by a Garmin watch and approximately 510 m reported by Google for a comparable route. Some recognised climb sections subjectively felt like they started later than the physical climb on the road.
    - Confirmed current implementation (recorded here as ground truth for any future analysis, not as an admission of a defect): ascent/descent totals (`src/navigation/elevation.ts`) resample raw route-point elevation at `RESAMPLE_STEP_METRES = 20` m (flat-extrapolating), apply a centred moving-average smoothing window of `SMOOTHING_WINDOW_SAMPLES = 5` samples (~100 m at that spacing), and accumulate with a `MIN_ASCENT_DELTA_METRES = 1` m reversal threshold — this pipeline runs independently of, though sharing constants/helpers with, the gradient/climb-detection pipeline below. Local gradient and climb/descent detection (`src/navigation/gradient.ts`, `src/navigation/routeFeatures.ts`) share the same 20 m resample step and reuse the elevation module's smoothing window; local gradient is fitted by least-squares regression over a `GRADE_BASELINE_WINDOW_METRES = 100` m centred window (minimum usable window `MIN_GRADE_WINDOW_METRES = 40` m near a run's edges), with runs split apart by gaps over `MAX_ELEVATION_GAP_METRES = 500` m and short (`MIN_SEGMENT_LENGTH_METRES = 80` m) classification flicker suppressed. Climb recognition requires length ≥ `MIN_FEATURE_LENGTH_METRES = 500` m, average gradient ≥ `MIN_CLIMB_AVERAGE_GRADIENT_PERCENT = 3` %, and Garmin's own published `climbScore ≥ MIN_CLIMB_SCORE = 1500`; a boundary only confirms once a reversal exceeds `REVERSAL_BRIDGE_ELEVATION_METRES = 10` m or persists past `REVERSAL_BRIDGE_DISTANCE_METRES = 200` m of distance since the tracked extremum (a flat lead-in/plateau within `FLAT_EPSILON_METRES = 0.01` m of the current extremum is treated as neither extending nor reversing). None of the above trusts a provider-supplied ascent/descent summary — ACN always recomputes from route-point elevation itself, per this project's long-standing "do not sum raw positive elevation noise" GPX rule.
    - Treat this strictly as an evidence-gathering investigation, not a confirmed provider-data defect, and not a request to retune any constant above yet.
    - Required investigation before any tuning proposal: compare the exact ACN-exported planned GPX for the ride in question against the corresponding Garmin-recorded GPX/FIT activity, aligned by distance and geography — ask the user to supply both files explicitly for a dedicated future analysis task; keep them local, never commit or retain them, and allow the user to trim privacy-sensitive sections first, per this project's "never commit personal GPX files" rule. Report, from that comparison: route-point spacing in each file, ACN's raw-vs-smoothed elevation profile, ACN's cumulative ascent under the current algorithm above, and exactly where recognised climb boundaries differ from where the rider judged the physical climb to start/end. Treat Garmin and Google's own figures as comparison data points, not ground truth — they may use different elevation sources (barometric vs. digital-elevation-model), their own smoothing, and their own ascent thresholds, none of which ACN can inspect. Get the user to clarify, with a concrete reproducible case, what "later" means for the climb-boundary complaint: the coloured map boundary (`routeFeatureLayer.ts`), the highlighted elevation-chart section, or the automatic active-Climb view's own entry point (`climbElevationView.ts`) — three distinct presentation layers over the same underlying boundary that could diverge from each other even if the boundary itself is correct.
    - Only after that analysis should a separate, later-numbered implementation slice propose any change to smoothing, the reversal threshold, climb-boundary hysteresis, or elevation-source handling — any such proposal must quantify its effect across several representative routes (not just the one ride that prompted this), and add deterministic regression fixtures rather than tuning purely to match one ride's Garmin/Google numbers.

## Item 60 — Battery consumption investigation and possible battery-saving mode

_Category: Battery and performance investigation_

60. **Battery consumption investigation and possible battery-saving mode**
    - Field observation (hypothesis-level, not a confirmed cause): an approximately two-hour installed iPhone PWA route ride saw battery fall from roughly 90% to below 20%. A separate, approximately ten-minute walking free-roam test (already recorded under item 42's own manual-acceptance entry) showed no obvious heat or battery drain, but was too short to validate representative endurance.
    - Record contributing factors as hypotheses only, not conclusions: high screen brightness/keeping the display awake; the app's current light presentation, particularly on an OLED device; continuous high-accuracy `watchPosition` use; MapLibre rendering and camera-update/easing frequency; cellular tile downloads, weak signal, or other device/environmental conditions; device model, battery health, and ambient temperature. A PWA cannot directly control hardware screen brightness; browser geolocation has no dependable application-controlled update interval; and the project must not trade away navigation reliability merely to claim better battery life.
    - Stage the work, and do not conflate the stages:
      1. **Measurement and diagnosis:** define a repeatable 60–120 minute real-device test procedure recording phone model, iOS version, battery health, system appearance, approximate brightness, wake-lock use, active screen, signal conditions, start/end battery percentage, perceived heat, and route/free-roam mode. Any opt-in developer diagnostics added for this must not retain location/speed history and must not become analytics/telemetry, per this project's explicit non-goals.
      2. **Low-risk rendering audit:** inspect for unnecessary React rerenders, MapLibre repaint/camera-easing frequency, hidden/off-screen chart or map work, and network tile churn. Require a measured, reproducible issue before changing anything found here.
      3. **Possible battery-saving presentation, gated on evidence from stages 1–2:** consider a manually selectable dark/OLED-friendly active-Riding theme and a compatible dark/dim map style, preserving outdoor contrast, route/warning colours, attribution/licensing requirements, and accessibility. A dark UI alone does not address GPS/rendering cost or a bright map style, and must not be described as a proven fix by itself.
      4. **Higher-risk power changes, gated on comparative field evidence only:** do not lower GPS accuracy, weaken manoeuvre timing, degrade Follow reliability, or silently disable wake lock. Any such option must be explicit, reversible, off by default, and tested against navigation accuracy as well as battery use before being offered.
    - Keep the investigation (stages 1–2) and any eventual feature (stages 3–4) as clearly separate future slices, each with its own acceptance evidence — do not implement stage 3/4 work on the strength of the single two-hour ride reported here.

## Item 61 — Android GPX share-sheet import feasibility

_Category: Platform compatibility_

61. **Android GPX share-sheet import feasibility**
    - Field observation: on Android, opening a GPX file received through WhatsApp currently offers only `Open with` choices (no ability to save to Files first), and the installed ACN PWA is not offered as an option there.
    - Platform distinction (re-verify against current official documentation before acting on it, since browser capability support changes over time): the web File Handling API (which can register a PWA as a file's default handler for an `Open with` chooser) is documented by Chrome as desktop-only today — it is not expected to make an installed Android PWA appear in an `Open with .gpx` chooser. The Web Share Target API is a distinct mechanism that can let an installed Android PWA appear as a target in a genuine Android Share/Send sheet — this depends on WhatsApp/Android actually exposing a Share/Send action for the received file, which is unconfirmed for this exact flow. A static GitHub Pages PWA can potentially implement a Web Share Target through its manifest plus service-worker/Workbox request handling, without an application server — this remains to be prototyped, not assumed to already work. This cannot make ACN appear in an `Open with`-only chooser under any of the above; it only helps if a genuine Share/Send path exists for this file. Useful, but not yet re-verified, official starting points: <https://developer.chrome.com/docs/capabilities/web-apis/file-handling>, <https://web.dev/web-share-target>, <https://web.dev/articles/workbox-share-targets> — check current status before relying on any detail from them.
    - Confirmed repository state: no Web Share Target, File Handling API, `share_target`/`file_handlers` manifest field, or related service-worker route exists anywhere in the current codebase (confirmed by an exhaustive case-insensitive grep). This is a fresh feasibility item, not a partially-built feature.
    - Stage the work, gated at each step:
      1. **Real-device flow capture and feasibility:** obtain screenshots or a screen recording of the exact WhatsApp menu/chooser on the user's real Android device, plus Android/Chrome/WhatsApp version numbers, to determine whether a genuine Share/Send path exists at all. Record the result as real-device evidence, distinct from any later Chromium-emulated Playwright coverage.
      2. **Static prototype, only if step 1 finds a Share path:** prove an installed Android PWA can register as a file share target under the project's current Vite PWA/Workbox configuration and GitHub Pages base-path deployment, covering both app-closed and app-already-open invocation.
      3. **Local GPX import integration, only if step 2 succeeds:** accept `.gpx` and realistic MIME types via the share target, validate through the existing file-size/XML/coordinate/import pipeline unchanged, never upload the file anywhere, and show a clear foreground review/confirmation or error state. Any service-worker handoff buffering the shared file must be short-lived and must not retain personal GPX data indefinitely.
      4. **Conflict and recovery coverage:** an inbound share must respect the existing unfinished route/free-roam conflict guard (item 42's fail-closed `checkFreeRoamConflict`-style pattern) and must never silently replace an active session or Planning draft; it must work after a fresh install/relaunch. Add Playwright coverage where meaningful, then require real Android Chrome acceptance — Chromium/Playwright emulation cannot prove real OS share-sheet registration, matching this project's existing, repeatedly-stated distinction between the `android-chrome` Playwright project and genuine physical-device verification (item 25).
    - If step 1 finds only an `Open with` path and no Share/Send path, document that conclusively and record that no pure static-PWA solution is currently available for this exact flow — do not propose a native wrapper, Trusted Web Activity, APK, or other Android-specific packaging as a workaround; that would be a major architecture departure and is explicitly not approved by this backlog item.
    - Requires the "## Explicit non-goals" edit recorded above (item 61's own cross-reference) — that section stays in the root `CLAUDE.md` and already carries this cross-reference.
